Description: Inference concerning Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in polyploids.
    Methods are available to test for HWE at any ploidy level in the presence
    of double reduction. For autopolyploid populations in HWE, methods are available
    to estimate the degree of doulbe reduction. We also provide functions
    to calculate genotype frequencies at equilibrium given rates of doulbe reduction.
