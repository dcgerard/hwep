Description: Inference concerning equilibrium and random mating in 
    autopolyploids. Methods are available to test for equilibrium 
    and random mating at any even ploidy level (>2) in the presence
    of double reduction. For autopolyploid populations in equilibrium,
    methods are available to estimate the degree of double reduction. 
    We also provide functions to calculate genotype frequencies at
    equilibrium, or after one or several rounds of random mating, 
    given rates of double reduction. The main function is
    `hwefit()`.
